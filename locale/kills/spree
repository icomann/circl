{1} killed someone, yay.
-
{1} wants another.
-
{0}'s the third, but hardly the charm.
Ooohhhh baby.
-
{0} is just another notch on {1}'s weapon.
Four dead at {1}'s hand!
-
{1}'s self-esteem is finally saved.
{0} just wants to read {1}'s killing spree lines.
-
Don't feel bad, {0}, up to five others helped.
-
There aren't even notches on {1}'s gun at this point, just a big dent.
Fancy that, {1} knows how to play.
{1}, is it really still fun?
